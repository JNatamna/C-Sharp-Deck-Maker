# Deck Shuffler
A terminal application that creates one instance of a deck and fills it with 52 cards that are normally in a deck. The order of the cards is randomized, and the deck is filled with one card at the time using lock to make sure the method is thread safe so that cards can not be affixed by an already stored value.
